<Description>
This is a website to provide Santa Clara U. students a platform where they can buy and sell used books. 
To help students find books easily and avoid being ripped off by book stores, Kitaab seems to be an urgent and necessary need.
By using this site, the used books will be available at a reasonable and affordable price to the students.
